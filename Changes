     correctly.

   - Added support for positiveInteger, negativeInteger,
     nonPositiveInteger and nonNegativeInteger.  (adamk@ali.as)

   - Fixed bug where references to elements inside complex types
     wouldn't get resolved.

1.05 2003-11-13

         float
         duration
         time
         date
         gYearMonth

         gMonthDay
         gDay
         gMonth
         hexBinary
         base64Binary
         anyURI
         QName
         NOTATION

1.04  2003-10-06
   - Added support for minOccurs and maxOccurs with <sequence>,
     <choice> and <all>.

   - Fixed bug in cache implementation that allowed some state from a
     failed validation run to leak into subsequent runs.

   - Added support for use as a SAX filter anywhere in a SAX pipeline.

1.03  2003-10-03
   - Added cache mode to reuse schema objects between calls.

   - Added support for more builtin simpleTypes: normalizedString,
     token, short, byte, unsignedInt, unsignedShort, unsignedByte

   - Added support for element and attribute refs.

   - Added support for simpleContent.

   - Fixed bug preventing <simpleType> within <sequence> or <choice>
     from working.

   - Fixed NMTOKEN implementation to derive from token instead of string.

   - Fixed bug where test suite would fail if XML::SAX::RTF was
     installed.

1.02  2003-10-01
   - Added support for composition of <sequence> and <choice> groups.

   - Added support for <simpleType>, both named and anonymous, with
     mostly complete <restriction> support.

   - Added automated test to run test suite against Xerces/C++ if
     available.  This should keep our tests in line with expected
     reality.

   - Modified test suite to run tests against all available SAX parsers.
