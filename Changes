Revision history for XML::Validator::Schema

1.00  2003-09-25
   - First Release.

1.01  2003-09-26
   - Fixed compatibility with XML::LibXML.

   - Modified test suite to run tests against all available SAX parsers.

   - Added support for simple <choice> and <all> content modules (no
     combinations yet).

1.02  2003-10-01
   - Added support for composition of <sequence> and <choice> groups.

   - Added support for <simpleType>, both named and anonymous, with
     mostly complete <restriction> support.

     available.  This should keep our tests in line with expected
     reality.
