Revision history for XML::Validator::Schema

1.00  2003-09-25
   - First Release.

1.01  2003-09-26
   - Fixed compatibility with XML::LibXML.

   - Modified test suite to run tests against all available SAX parsers.

   - Added support for simple <choice> and <all> content modules (no
     combinations yet).

1.02  2003-10-01
   - Added support for composition of <sequence> and <choice> groups.

   - Added support for <simpleType>, both named and anonymous, with
     mostly complete <restriction> support.

   - Added automated test to run test suite against Xerces/C++ if
     available.  This should keep our tests in line with expected
     reality.

   - Added support for more builtin simpleTypes: normalizedString,

   - Fixed bug preventing <simpleType> within <sequence> or <choice>
     from working.

   - Fixed NMTOKEN implementation to derive from token instead of string.

   - Fixed bug where test suite would fail if XML::SAX::RTF was
     installed.

1.04  2003-10-06
   - Added support for minOccurs and maxOccurs with <sequence>,
     <choice> and <all>.

   - Fixed bug in cache implementation that allowed some state from a
     failed validation run to leak into subsequent runs.

   - Added support for use as a SAX filter anywhere in a SAX pipeline.
