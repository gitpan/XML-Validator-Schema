     definitions.  (reported by Jeremy Osborn)

     correctly.

         float
         duration

         gYearMonth

         gMonthDay
         gDay

         hexBinary
         base64Binary
         anyURI
         QName
         NOTATION

1.04  2003-10-06
   - Added support for minOccurs and maxOccurs with <sequence>,
     <choice> and <all>.

   - Fixed bug in cache implementation that allowed some state from a
     failed validation run to leak into subsequent runs.

   - Added support for use as a SAX filter anywhere in a SAX pipeline.

1.03  2003-10-03
   - Added cache mode to reuse schema objects between calls.

   - Added support for more builtin simpleTypes: normalizedString,
     token, short, byte, unsignedInt, unsignedShort, unsignedByte

   - Added support for element and attribute refs.

   - Added support for simpleContent.

   - Fixed bug preventing <simpleType> within <sequence> or <choice>

   - Added support for <simpleType>, both named and anonymous, with
     mostly complete <restriction> support.

   - Fixed compatibility with XML::LibXML.

   - Modified test suite to run tests against all available SAX parsers.
