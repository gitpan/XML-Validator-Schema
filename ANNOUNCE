ANNOUNCEMENT: XML::Validator::Schema 1.02

CHANGES

  1.02  2003-10-01
   - Added support for composition of <sequence> and <choice> groups.

   - Added support for <simpleType>, both named and anonymous, with
     mostly complete <restriction> support.

   - Added automated test to run test suite against Xerces/C++ if
     available.  This should keep our tests in line with expected
     reality.
