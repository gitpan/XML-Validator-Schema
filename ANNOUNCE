   - Fixed a bug which broke date type checking in Perl v5.10.

DESCRIPTION

    This module allows you to validate XML documents against a W3C XML
    Schema. This module does not implement the full W3C XML Schema
    recommendation (http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema), but a useful subset. See
    the SCHEMA SUPPORT section in the module documention.

    IMPORTANT NOTE: To get line and column numbers in the error
    messages generated by this module you must install
    XML::Filter::ExceptionLocator and use XML::SAX::ExpatXS as your
    SAX parser.  This module is much more useful if you can tell where
    your errors are, so using these modules is highly recommeded!
